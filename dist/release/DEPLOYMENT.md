# OSCAR Administrator Guide

OSCAR runs as three Docker Compose services: an HTTPS gateway, the non-root OSCAR application, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. The selected HTTPS port is published to the host, and port 80 redirects requests to HTTPS. PostgreSQL has no host port.

Start with [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for installation. This guide documents deployment choices and routine administration.

## Supported initial hosts

- Windows 11 x86-64 with Docker Desktop and WSL 2
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 x86-64 with Docker Engine and the Compose plugin
- Apple Silicon macOS with Docker Desktop; optional native-backed features may be unavailable and PostGIS runs under AMD64 emulation

## Administrative CLI

Use `oscar.bat` on Windows and `oscar.sh` on Ubuntu or macOS.

Opening either launcher with no arguments starts a persistent `oscar>` administration menu. On Windows, double-clicking `oscar.bat` requests UAC elevation automatically; an Administrator PowerShell window does not need to be opened first. On graphical Linux, opening the executable `oscar.sh` starts the menu in a terminal. On macOS, open the executable script in Terminal. Desktop file-execution policy varies, so direct terminal commands remain the supported fallback. Ubuntu Server has no graphical launcher and is administered from its terminal.

The menu accepts the same command and options shown below. For example, enter `init`, `status`, `logs -Service postgres -Follow` on Windows, or `logs --service postgres --follow` on Ubuntu/macOS. Enter `exit` to close the menu. Supplying arguments directly bypasses the menu, preserving automation compatibility.

| Action | Windows | Ubuntu/macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initialize | `oscar.bat init` | `sudo bash oscar.sh init` |
| Check prerequisites | `oscar.bat check` | `sudo bash oscar.sh check` |
| Verify offline media | `oscar.bat verify` | `sudo bash oscar.sh verify` |
| Start | `oscar.bat start` | `sudo bash oscar.sh start` |
| Stop | `oscar.bat stop` | `sudo bash oscar.sh stop` |
| Restart | `oscar.bat restart` | `sudo bash oscar.sh restart` |
| Status | `oscar.bat status` | `sudo bash oscar.sh status` |
| Logs | `oscar.bat logs` | `sudo bash oscar.sh logs` |
| Upgrade | `oscar.bat upgrade` | `sudo bash oscar.sh upgrade` |

Directly invoked mutating commands require an elevated Administrator PowerShell window on Windows or root privileges on Ubuntu/macOS. The Windows menu obtains elevation through UAC, and the Unix menu invokes `sudo` when a selected command requires it.

`start`, `stop`, and `restart` never build or download images. `init` and `upgrade` may prepare missing images for a connected release. If `offline-images.tar` is present, image preparation uses only that archive and fails if any required image remains unavailable.

Offline releases are published in two Windows x86-64 profiles:

- `offline-full` contains OSCAR images plus the approved Docker Desktop and WSL installers.
- `offline-images` contains OSCAR images only and requires Docker Desktop, WSL 2, and Docker Compose to be installed and running already.

Initialization defaults to `-Prerequisites auto`, which uses a working existing Docker installation and only launches bundled installers when Docker is unavailable. Use `-Prerequisites existing` to prohibit prerequisite installation, or `-Prerequisites bundled` to explicitly permit the bundled fallback. The Unix equivalents are `--prerequisites auto|existing|bundled`.

## Initial setup options

The defaults are hostname `oscar.local`, HTTPS port `443`, and a self-signed certificate. Setup asks for an administrator password of at least 14 characters, generates unique database credentials, validates TLS, and starts the deployment.

With the default HTTPS port, entering the configured hostname without a scheme is supported: the gateway redirects the browser from HTTP to HTTPS while preserving the requested path. Deployments using a nonstandard HTTPS port must include that port in the URL printed by setup.

Windows example with an imported certificate:

```powershell
.\oscar.bat init -Hostname oscar.example.org -Port 443 `
    -TlsMode import -CertificatePath C:\certs\server.crt `
    -PrivateKeyPath C:\certs\server.key
```

Ubuntu/macOS equivalent:

```sh
sudo bash oscar.sh init --hostname oscar.example.org --port 443 \
    --tls-mode import --certificate /secure/server.crt \
    --private-key /secure/server.key
```

By default, setup maps the hostname only on the OSCAR host. Use `-SkipHostsEntry` or `--skip-hosts-entry` to leave local host resolution unchanged. Site DNS or a hosts entry is still required on every workstation that connects to OSCAR.

`server.crt` must be a PEM certificate or chain. `server.key` must be its matching unencrypted PEM private key. The certificate subject alternative names must contain every DNS name or IP address used to reach OSCAR.

For an isolated deployment, administrators may use a deployment-specific certificate authority and install only its public certificate on workstations. Never place the certificate-authority private key in this release directory, a container, or a diagnostic bundle.

## Windows offline installation

Extract the offline ZIP into a local NTFS directory. From an Administrator PowerShell window:

```powershell
.\verify-bundle.ps1
.\oscar.bat init
```

The equivalent CLI command is `oscar.bat verify`. After successful verification, OSCAR records the hash of `SHA256SUMS`. Later `init` and `upgrade` operations skip the expensive full-file pass while that manifest remains unchanged. A replacement bundle with a different manifest invalidates the receipt and is verified again automatically. Routine commands do not perform full bundle verification; run `verify` explicitly whenever post-installation tampering is suspected.

The full artifact can launch the bundled official installers when WSL or Docker Desktop is missing. The images-only artifact must be initialized with a working existing runtime:

```powershell
.\oscar.bat init -Prerequisites existing
```

If an installer requires a restart, restart Windows and run `oscar.bat init` again.

The offline CLI does not contact package repositories or container registries. Docker Desktop licensing must be reviewed independently by the deploying organization.

## Logs

The default displays the last 200 lines from all services and exits:

```powershell
.\oscar.bat logs
```

Select a service and optionally follow it:

```powershell
.\oscar.bat logs -Service oscar -Tail 500
.\oscar.bat logs -Service postgres -Follow
.\oscar.bat logs -Service gateway
```

Ubuntu/macOS uses `--service`, `--tail`, and `--follow`.

## Persistent state and secrets

Initialization creates:

```text
.env
secrets/oscar-admin-password.txt
secrets/oscar-db-password.txt
secrets/postgres-bootstrap-password.txt
tls/server.crt
tls/server.key
```

Docker Compose mounts secrets read-only. On Ubuntu, the setup CLI makes `secrets` and `tls` mode `0700`, with contained files readable by the deliberately non-root services. On Windows, it restricts the directories to the installing administrator and `SYSTEM` while preserving container-readable, read-only mounts.

The application configuration is copied into the `oscar_state` volume on first startup. Runtime configuration saves update only that persistent copy. Application libraries and viewer assets remain read-only in the image. PostgreSQL data is stored in the `postgres_data` volume.

`oscar stop` retains containers and both data volumes. Never run `docker compose down --volumes` unless permanent deletion of all OSCAR and PostgreSQL data is explicitly intended.

WebID is disabled by default. Failure to reach an optional configured WebID endpoint must not prevent OSCAR from starting.

## Security verification

After startup:

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose exec postgres psql --username oscar_bootstrap --dbname gis --command "SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolcreatedb, rolcreaterole, rolreplication, rolbypassrls FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'oscar_app';"
```

Every reported privilege flag for `oscar_app` must be false. A host scan must show port `80` and the configured HTTPS port, and must not show ports `8282` or `5432`. Port `80` must return only an HTTPS redirect.

## Upgrade

Back up the deployment first. Extract the new release over the existing deployment directory while preserving `.env`, `secrets/`, and `tls/`. Release archives do not contain those runtime files. Then run:

```powershell
.\oscar.bat upgrade
```

```sh
sudo bash oscar.sh upgrade
```

The command reads the target version from the new release, updates only `OSCAR_VERSION` in the preserved `.env`, validates Compose, prepares the versioned images, recreates changed services, waits for health checks, and retains the fixed `oscar_state` and `postgres_data` volumes. It never removes volumes. Confirm the result with `oscar.bat status` (Windows) or `sudo bash oscar.sh status` (Ubuntu).

On Windows, OSCAR grants the local `docker-users` group read-only access to the protected `secrets` and `tls` directories so Docker Desktop can mount them. This is required when setup is elevated with a different administrator account than the signed-in account running Docker Desktop. The group receives temporary write access only while `init` generates or imports the certificate.

Database backup/restore, certificate renewal, rollback automation, and version-specific configuration migration are planned administrator operations and must be completed before upgrades are declared production-ready.

## Compatibility scripts

`setup.*`, `launch-all.*`, and `stop-all.*` remain as compatibility wrappers. New documentation and automation should use only `oscar.bat` or `oscar.sh`.

Offline map layers are not currently required. The CLI retains an explicit MBTiles import TODO for a future milestone.
